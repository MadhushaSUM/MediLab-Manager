# MediLab-Manager
MediLab Manager is a software application developed to manage a medical laboratory.

The application is developed to focus on 3 stages.
  1. Collect patient details and register them for the tests.
  2. Save the results of the tests performed.
  3. Print reports.

In addition to these tasks, the admin user can run a financial analysis to review the income of the medical laboratory. And also has features to perform patient analysis (to review data of a selected patient) and test analysis (to review data of a selected test)

There is an admin login and a user login. And the admin can edit the passwords of both the admin user and the regular user.

The user can edit the default report base. This means the report's default font, position, and style can be changed. And if somehow the saved configuration is deleted or corrupted the application can automatically reload the default configuration without throwing any error.

EGFR calculator is also included.

Standard calculations are performed and relevant fields of the report are filled automatically. For example in the Full Blood Count test, when the Haemoglobin value, PCV value, and RBC value are entered, MCV, MCH, MCHC values are automatically calculated and filled. 

According to pre-defined ranges, tests are flagged HIGH, or LOW.

Two or more reports can be merged into a single paper for printing.
